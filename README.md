# 100-Days-of-ML-Pt2

Daily log to track my progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge.

## Description ##

100 Day ML Challenge to learn and develop machine learning products. Since this is my second time performing this challenge, this time around I will be focusing more on the production enviroment rather than the concepts and theory behind ML/DL models. I will be placing heavy emphasis on the ML pipeline and the process of taking an ML model and applying into a real-world application.

## Challenge Goals ##

- [x] Learn how to deploy ML models into production.
- [x] Learn about scripting for MLOps
- [ ] Learn about the ML Pipeline
- [ ] Learn more about privacy & protection for ML applications
- [ ] Learn the CI/CD for ML
- [ ] Learn about CUDA and get hands on experience
- [ ] Learn more about deep reinforcement learning
	- [x] Markov Chains
	- [ ] Markov Decision Processes
- [ ] Learn more about generative learning
- [ ] Learn about AWS microservices

[Additional]
- Milti-modal Systems
- Apache Flume
- [x] Apache Beam
- MySQL/Apache Spark
- PostgreSQL
- Optimizing/architecting software/hardware solutions for ML

# 100-Days-of-ML-Pt2

Daily log to track my progress on the 100 days of ML code challenge.

## Description ##

100 Day ML Challenge to learn and develop machine learning products. Since this is my second time performing this challenge, this time around I will be focusing more on the production enviroment rather than the concepts and theory behind ML/DL models. I will be placing heavy emphasis on the ML pipeline and the process of taking an ML model and applying into a real-world application.

## Challenge Goals ##

- Learn how to deploy ML models into production.
- Learn about the ML Pipeline
- Learn more about privacy & protection for ML applications
- Learn the CI/CD for ML
- Learn about CUDA and get hands on experience
- Learn more about deep reinforcement learning
- Learn more about generative learning
- Learn about AWS microservices

[Additional]
- Apache Flume
- MySQL/Apache Spark
- PostgreSQL
- Optimizing/architecting software/hardware solutions for ML
